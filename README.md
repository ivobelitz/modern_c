# "Modern C" Learning Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions and implementations of exercises and challenges while studying "Modern C". It serves as both a learning journal and a reference for C programming concepts.

## How to Use

1. Each solution is contained in its own directory
2. Comments in the code explain the thought process and implementation details

## Building and Running

Most exercises can be compiled using:

**Linux:**
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o output_file source_file.c
```
**macOS:**
```bash
clang -Wall -Wextra -o output_file source_file.c
```

Run the compiled program:

```bash
./output_file
```

## Important Notes
